# DTTPHackathon-DiabetesRiskTool

The Diabetes Risk Assessment Tool is an app that assesses individuals’ risk of developing type 2 diabetes based on factors such as age, family history, body mass index (BMI), physical activity level, and dietary habits. The app also features a dynamic Wellness Hub where users can also track their Physical activity, Screen time, Meals and get daily Affirmations. 

## Technology used 
While building this project, technology used include VS Code, Flutter and Android Studio. One challenge encountered while building this project is the unfamiliarity with Flutter for us developers as we were more accustomed to building websites vs apps. We overcame this challenge by watching several tutorials which improved our understanding of and ability to use Flutter. The full list of questions and how the risk score is calculated can be accessed in the questions folder.
